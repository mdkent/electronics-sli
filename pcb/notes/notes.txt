Process
-------

# Adjusted ultiboard pcb settings and design rules to match minimums for BatchPCB and others manufacturers
# Sized board
# Added plated through holes for mounting
# Autoplaced components on board
# Arranged components based on accessbility first
# Arranged components for split power planes (5v, 9v)
# Arranged components to group similar parts
# Arranged components for asthetics
# Add power planes, tweaking the various options to elminate unconnected islands
# Many, many runs of the auto routing and moving components around to make the traces as simple as possible
# Added labels to everything possible


Successes
---------

* Learned a fair bit about Ultiboard
* Learned quite a bit about pcb layout best practices and terminology
* Board works!
* BatchPCB boards look great, only 1 visible silkscreen defect
* Handles 21 leds with 150mA okay


Issues
------

* 9V DC - Power plug pins not properly sized, positive is too small
* J1 - Not enough clearance for 10 pin idc connector for leds
* Q3 - Via in label
* J2, J5, J4 - Rotate to outside edge for right angle header connectors
* C3, C7, C9 - Move to right of gain, space for other connectorson similar edge
* Base screw holes on actual screw dimensions with standoffs
* No docs on max amps the board can handle
* No real data on how wide traces should be, just best guesses
* Not enough research into usage and layout of wide traces, unclear if they have any benefit at all
* My soldering iron sucks, need a finer tip
* Need a better hands free clamp, cheap one is flimsy and needs more arms
