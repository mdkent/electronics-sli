An electronics project to drive leds with sound levels.


About
-----

This repository is a complete representation of my first end to end electronics project - an implementation of the great [Sound Level Indicator designed by audioguru](http://www.electronics-lab.com/projects/motor_light/002/index.html)

The finished product can be viewed here (youtube this).


Goal
----

The goal of this project was to: 

* Work through the complete design process and build a finished product
* Work with various new materials
* x


History
-------

I discovered audioguru's implementation when researching microphone sensitivity issues with my own attempts. His circuit was far more advanced and awesome with it's automatic gain control so I chose to run with it instead.
